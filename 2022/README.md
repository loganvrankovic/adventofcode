## JavaScript solutions for Advent of Code 2022
2023's goal was to get better at JS, but for 2022 I want to do it with JS but a little faster. For each 2022 puzzle, I set a timer. A very different experience. I took as long as I wanted with 2023, mostly because I dedicated unreasonably big amounts of time to parsing the input data as thoroughly as possible. For 2022, putting myself on a time limit is forcing me to do less with parsing which makes me focus on using the input right away.
